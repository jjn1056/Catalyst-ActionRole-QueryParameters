Revision history for Perl extension Catalyst::ActionRole::QueryParameter

0.05    27 April 2015
        - match_captures is now always defined in Catalyst::Action so we changed
        the role to not overwrite it.
        - Catalyst supports ActionRoles natively in a controller for a long time
        so updated the Minimun Catalyst version and removed previous code.
